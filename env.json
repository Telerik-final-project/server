  "textFirst": "Invented in 2004 by our Chef Toussaint - the best chocolate recipes incorporated into a piece of chocolate with a spoon. Stir, and you get REAL hot chocolate instead of a powder. You can taste the difference right away. <br><br> The Hotchocspoon remains our favorite, but we have a lot more products now, because with quality chocolate you can think of so many delicious recipes! We put, for example, a lot of work and attention into our chocolates (we call them \"Bombons\" full of taste). In 2015, our nuts about you bombons were therefore chosen as the best-Valentine chocolates by Kassa Vara.<br><br> Premium cocoa beans from different origins, not just each bean, fine pralines and icings. Every day we think of tasty recipes again, what goes with what and in what proportions we bring them together?<br><br>Our chocolate designers \"cook\" with real chocolate, as a real chef would do. Everything we make at CHCO is handmade and our pastries in the cafes come from an artisan bakery.",
  "textSecond": "Chocolate Company is a real family, and after years of hard fighting for the cause, Toussaint is still associated with the company as a product developer. His wife Miriam, who started their first chocolate shop, now has the daily management of the chocolate workshop. Both are also co-owner of the sister company Chocolate Company Retail which ensures that we can offer all those delicious recipes in our glorious Chocolate Company Cafes. You can enjoy a delicious cup of coffee or a quick coffee to go, and it always goes with a smile! ",
